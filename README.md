# Swag-of-Tools
A Collection of Utilities for JRiver Media Center

More Details and the thread for discusion is at - https://yabb.jriver.com/interact/index.php/topic,106802.0.html

Description:  "Swag of Tools" is a collection of my scripts in a single GUI maintaining a consistent Look and Feel and includes:
- Chapterfy:  Creates Chapter Based Particles (so you can manage Music Videos on a per Track Basis as you can a CD)
- Particlise:  Bulk Creation of Particles
- Data Fiddler:  Lets you Import / Export / Update the MC Library from a Spreadsheet
- Media Checker:  Checks if Items on your HDD are actually in you Library
- Burn2BD:  Transcodes a Video for the Production of a Blu-ray ISO (optionally lets you then burn it to a disk)
- MediaInfo:  Uses Media Info to get the information of you media file and will update MC including if the Audio contains Atmos/DTS:X
- Filename Updater:  Allows you to manually correct the "Filename" field even for items like Particles that can not be updated in the MC GUI

How to use:  Attached to this post are Zip files that contains the AutoHotKey Script and a both a 32 and 64-Bit compiled version:
- It will only run in Windows and is GUI based
- It needs no install, just extract the version you want to a handy folder and run it from there.
- When you first run MC Tool Box it will create a .ini file (for the MCWS logon details) and add "Sent To" shortcuts in MC for many commands (but you may need to run it "As Administrator" this first time to add these links).
- You can then either use one of the "Right Click --> Send To --> Send To (external) -->" short cuts to run just that one command or run the EXE directly (or if you have AHK Installed the AHK script) to see the full menu of available options and their descriptions. 
- If you were using any of my standalone versions or older versions, you should remove their links in "Right Click --> Send To --> Send To (external) --> Add/Edit Programs"

Notes, Limitations, Future Stuff: 
- Let me know of the bugs.... There will be rough edges around this for now
- Make sure you Backup your Library First as there is no "undo" function and you can change a whole bunch of stuff!
- Let me know of any Feature Requests or Enhancements
